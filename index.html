    <h1>Current Skills</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Proficient in the Swift Programming Language
            <p>I have been programming in Swift for over 2 years and I've very 
                comfortable with the syntax of the language and the "Swifty" way of doing things.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Comfortable Programming in Xcode and making general purpose iOS apps.
            <p>
                I've been making apps basically since I started learning Swift. 
                I've always been a technology person and I love the iPhone and Apple products.
                Apple's suite of tools for building iPhone apps makes me very productive and it's very enjoyable.

    <h1>Skills Currently Learning/Aquiring</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Know the basics of Python and can make basic scripts with it but haven't really gone any further than that.
            Python is a great language that I'll use sometimes to write up a quick script to automate some task.
        </li>
        <li>
            Started Learning Haskell at around the end of September 2021. 
            Currently a beginner in the language but am slowly progressing and understanding the functional programming paradigm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Started learning the basics of C# very recently with an interest in making desktop Windows applications.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Very Little Experience/Want To Learn</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            C - Know the most basic syntax of C but have never made any real program with it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ruby - Started learning the basics of ruby recently and it seems like a 
            cool scripting language that would be worth learning.
